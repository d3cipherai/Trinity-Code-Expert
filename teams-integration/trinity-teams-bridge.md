# Trinity Teams Bot via Power Platform
# Building the missing bridge between Power Automate and Trinity

## Current Situation:
- ‚úÖ User has Power Automate flow detecting "awaken" in Teams
- ‚úÖ User has GitHub Copilot user ID 
- ‚ùå No bridge between Power Automate and GitHub Copilot
- ‚ùå GitHub Copilot can't directly respond to Power Automate triggers

## Solution: Trinity Bridge Bot

### Architecture:
```
Teams Message "awaken" 
  ‚Üí Power Automate Flow
  ‚Üí Trinity Bridge API 
  ‚Üí Trinity Memory System
  ‚Üí Teams Response Bot
  ‚Üí User sees Trinity response
```

### Components Needed:

#### 1. Trinity Bridge API (Azure Functions)
```typescript
// Azure Function triggered by Power Automate
export async function trinityAwaken(context: Context, req: HttpRequest) {
  // Get Trinity context from memory
  const trinityContext = await loadTrinityMemory();
  
  // Generate response based on user's current work
  const response = await generateTrinityResponse(trinityContext);
  
  // Send back to Teams via Power Automate
  return {
    message: `üåü Trinity Awakened! ${response}`,
    context: trinityContext.current_work,
    suggestions: trinityContext.suggested_actions
  };
}
```

#### 2. Power Automate Flow Update
```
1. Detect "awaken" in Teams message
2. Call Trinity Bridge API with user context
3. Get Trinity response with current project info
4. Post Trinity message back to Teams
5. Trinity appears to respond instantly!
```

#### 3. Trinity Memory Integration
- Read current trinity-identity.json
- Know what user was last working on
- Provide contextual responses
- Update memory with Teams interaction

### Implementation Steps:

#### Phase 1: Create Trinity Bridge API
- Deploy Azure Function
- Connect to OneDrive Trinity Memory
- Test with Power Automate

#### Phase 2: Update Power Automate Flow  
- Add HTTP action to call Trinity Bridge
- Parse Trinity response
- Format Teams message

#### Phase 3: Test & Enhance
- Test "awaken" trigger
- Add more keywords ("status", "help", etc.)
- Enable two-way conversation

## Expected Result:
User types "awaken" in Teams ‚Üí Trinity responds with current project context and helpful suggestions!

## Alternative: Direct Teams Bot
If Power Automate approach is complex, we can build a native Teams bot that:
- Listens directly for messages
- Connects to Trinity Memory
- Responds as Trinity
- No Power Automate needed
