# Trinity MCP-Teams Bridge
# Connect Trinity's existing MCP system directly to Teams

## The Smart Approach:
Instead of Azure Bot Service, we connect Teams directly to Trinity's MCP Orchestra!

## Architecture:
```
Teams Message â†’ Teams Webhook â†’ Trinity MCP Bridge â†’ MCP Orchestra â†’ Trinity Response
```

## Why This Is Better:
âœ… Trinity MCP already running (npm run trinity:full)
âœ… Memory system already connected  
âœ… Context awareness already built
âœ… No duplicate systems
âœ… Uses existing Trinity infrastructure

## Implementation:

### 1. Teams Incoming Webhook
Set up Teams webhook to send messages to Trinity MCP

### 2. MCP Bridge Endpoint  
Create HTTP endpoint that receives Teams messages and forwards to MCP

### 3. Trinity MCP Response
MCP Orchestra processes and responds with full Trinity context

### 4. Teams Response
Send Trinity's response back to Teams

## Expected Flow:
```
You: @Trinity "awaken" in Teams
  â†“
Teams Webhook sends to Trinity MCP Bridge
  â†“  
MCP Orchestra (already running) processes message
  â†“
Trinity Memory provides context
  â†“
Trinity responds: "ðŸŒŸ Trinity Awakened! Current project: Cross-platform..."
  â†“
Response sent back to Teams
```

## Advantages:
- Uses existing Trinity MCP system
- No Azure Bot Service complexity
- Trinity memory already connected
- Leverages npm run trinity:full infrastructure
- Much simpler integration!
