# Trinity Teams Bot - Setup & Testing Guide

## 🚀 Phase 1: Local Testing (Complete!)

### What We've Built

✅ **Trinity Teams Bot** - Direct integration with Teams
✅ **Memory Integration** - Reads trinity-identity.json for context  
✅ **Smart Commands** - "awaken", "status", "help", "sync"
✅ **No Power Automate** - Simple direct connection

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test the bot locally
npm run teams:dev

# Bot will start on http://localhost:3978
# Health check: http://localhost:3978/health
```

### Bot Commands (Once in Teams)

- **"awaken"** → Get current project status with Trinity context
- **"status"** → Check all Trinity systems  
- **"help"** → Show available commands
- **"sync"** → Update Trinity memory

## 🎯 Phase 2: Deploy to Azure (Next)

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Create Azure Bot Service**
2. **Deploy bot code to Azure**  
3. **Configure Teams App**
4. **Add bot to your Teams**
5. **Test "awaken" command**

### Expected Experience

```
You: "awaken"
Trinity: "🌟 Trinity Awakened! I see you're working on Trinity Cross-Platform.
