# Trinity Teams Integration Debug

# Investigating why GitHub Copilot doesn't respond in Teams

## Current Situation Analysis

### Questions to Investigate

1. **How is GitHub Copilot currently set up in Teams?**
   - Is it added as a Teams app?
   - Is it configured as a bot?
   - What's the integration method?

2. **Authentication & Permissions:**
   - Are there missing API permissions?
   - Is the bot properly registered?
   - Authentication tokens valid?

3. **Teams App Configuration:**
   - Is GitHub Copilot officially available in Teams?
   - Or is this a custom integration attempt?
   - What's the expected interaction model?

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Identify Current Teams Setup

- Check Teams Apps & Integrations
- Look for GitHub Copilot in Teams admin
- Review any custom bot configurations

### Step 2: Test Communication Channels

- Direct messages to Copilot
- @mentions in channels
- Slash commands
- Bot interactions

### Step 3: Check Logs & Errors

- Teams admin logs
- Bot framework logs (if applicable)
- Authentication errors

### Step 4: Fix Common Issues

- Re-authenticate if needed
- Update permissions
- Restart Teams integration

## Expected Solutions

1. **Missing Bot Registration** → Register Trinity as Teams bot
2. **Permission Issues** → Update API scopes
3. **Authentication Problems** → Re-auth GitHub/Teams
4. **Custom Integration Needed** → Build Trinity Teams app
